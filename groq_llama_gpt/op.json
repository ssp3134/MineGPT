Standard of ventilation.– (1) It shall be the duty of the owner, agent or manager of every mine to take such steps as are necessary to constantly provide in all parts of the mine belowground which are not sealed off, adequate ventilation to clear away smoke, steam and dust, to dilute gases that are inflammable or noxious so as to render them harmless, to provide air containing sufficient oxygen and to prevent such excessive rise of temperature or humidity which may be harmful to the health of persons. (2) agent and manager shall ensure that-\n\n(a) in every ventilating district, not less than six cubic meters per minute of air per person employed in the district on the largest shift or not less than 2.5 cubic meters per minute of air per tonne of daily output, whichever is larger, passes along the last ventilation connection in the district which means the in-bye most gallery in the district along which the air passes;\n\n(b) at every place in the mine where persons are required to work or pass, the air does not contain less than 19 per cent. of oxygen or more than 0.5 per cent. of carbon dioxide or any noxious gas in quantity likely to affect the health of any person;\n\n(c) the percentage of inflammable gas does not exceed 0.75 in the general body of the return air of any\n\nventilating district and 1.25 in any place in the mine;\n\n(d)'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Coal Mines Regulation 2017.pdf'

(2) No working or gallery shall be extended to a distance of more than 3 meters from the nearest ventilation connection unless the current of air is coursed up to a point within 3 meters of the face by means of fire resistant pipes, tubes, brattices or other material.\n\n(3) No narrow main or advance gallery shall be driven more than three meters ahead of the widened gallery.\n\n(4) Every stopping between the main intake and the main return airway shall be substantially built and every air-crossing shall be so constructed and maintained as to withstand the force of an explosion.\n\n(5) The main air current shall be so split and coursed that an air current which ventilates a goaved out area, whether packed or unpacked, or any disused workings shall not, except with the prior permission in writing of the Regional Inspector and subject to such conditions as he may specify therein, ventilate any workings where coal is being extracted.\n\n¹Hkkx IIµ[k.M 3(i)º\n\nHkkjr dk jkti=k % vlk/kj.k\n\n(6) No major alteration shall be made in the system of ventilation except with the prior permission in writing of the Regional Inspector and subject to such conditions as he may specify therein:\n\nProvided that where the safety of the mine or of the persons employed therein is seriously threatened, the provisions of this sub-regulation shall be deemed to have been complied with, if information of such alteration is sent to the Regional Inspector forthwith.\n\n(7) Except in an emergency, when a major alteration is made in the system of ventilation, only such persons as are engaged in making the alteration shall be present belowground.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Coal Mines Regulation 2017.pdf'

Recovery and exploratory work.– (1) After an explosion of inflammable gas or coal dust has occurred in a mine, only such persons as are authorised by the manager or by the principal official present at the surface, shall be allowed to enter the mine.\n\n(2) Where it is intended or proposed to reopen a mine or part thereof, which has been isolated, sealed off or flooded with water to deal with a fire or spontaneous heating, the owner, agent or manager shall not less than thirty days before the commencement of such work, give notice in writing of such intention or proposal to the Regional Inspector and the Chief Inspector.\n\n(3) Where it is intended to carry out any exploratory work in a mine or part belowground likely to contain irrespirable atmosphere,-\n\n(a) all work shall be done under rescue cover only;\n\n(b) no party of less than three persons shall be allowed to proceed to carry out such work; and\n\n(c) every such party shall carry a suitable apparatus approved by the Chief Inspector for detecting\n\ncarbon monoxide gas and also an approved flame safety lamp.\n\n149. Danger from surface water.– (1) Where any mine or part thereof is so situated that there is any danger of inrush of surface water into the mine or part, adequate protection against such inrush shall be provided and maintained, and whether such protection is adequate or not may be determined by the Chief Inspector, whose decision shall be final.\n\n(2) Except with the previous permission of the Chief Inspector in writing and subject to such conditions as he may specify therein and subject to the provisions of sub-regulation (1), every entrance into a mine shall be so designed, constructed and maintained that its lowest point (which means the point at which a body of rising water on surface can enter the mine) shall be not less than 1.5 meters above the highest flood level at that point.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Coal Mines Regulation 2017.pdf'

Precautions against gas during de-watering and re-opening.- (1) No disused mine or shaft shall be de-watered except under the constant supervision of a competent person and during such de-watering, approved safety lamps or torches shall be exclusively used, and there shall also be kept burning at every place where persons are at work, at least one approved flame safety lamp. (2) The first inspection of a mine or part which is re-opened after discontinuance of mining operations for a period exceeding seven days and of any part of a mine after being de-watered, shall be made by a competent person with an approved flame safety lamp or other approved apparatus for determining presence of inflammable or noxious gases and deficiency of oxygen and during such inspection, no additional light or lamp other than an approved electric torch or lamp shall be used.\n\n(3) The result of every such inspection shall be recorded in a bound paged book kept for the purpose, and shall be signed and dated by the persons making the inspection, and countersigned and dated by the manager.\n\n166.
